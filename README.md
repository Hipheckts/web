The source code for my personal website is hosted here. It is a static site generated with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Even though I'm likely the only person to work on this site, feel free to [submit any issues](https://github.com/sunnysingh/web/issues/new) that you find on the site. If you also want to hack around with my code, just run `npm install` and `npm run serve` after you clone the repository.
